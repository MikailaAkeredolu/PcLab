# Assesmble a PC system (UML must be approved by Mikaila before you code)

### Part 1a - Create the following classes:
- Create a PC class that HAS a Case , Motherboard and a Monitor
- Create a **parameterized constructor** for PC containing all of its instance variables
- Create a **drawLogo()** method that is private , that takes and returns nothing butinside the method,**invokes/calls the drawPixel(x,y,z)** method on the monitor instancevariable in the PC class
- Create a public method called **description()** that takes and returns nothing butprints out the description of the case, monitor and motherboard but starting with themessage “Welcome to worst buy below is the description of the pc on sale today”

- Entrepreneur
- HumanResources
- HireDate
- CheckCashingPlace
### Part 1b - Create the following interface:
- IPayable

### Part 2 - Things Objects have
- Every Person has a name
- Employees and Entrepreneurs are people
- Employees have an HireDate
- HireDate has a month, date and year that are all text
- SalariedEmployees have a salary
- HourlyEmployees have hourlyRate and HoursWorked

### Part 3a - Things Objects can do
- There should be a method to **printBadge()** for any type of Employee in this format. 
- There should be a way to **calculatePay()** for all types of people (Employees and Entrepreneurs)
<pre><code>
Name: James
Type of employee: SalariedEmployee
HireDate: 2/30/2020

Name: Mike
Type of employee: HourlyEmployee
HireDate: 3/19/1999
</pre></code>

**In the HumanResources Class, there should be methods that can:**
- **issueBadge(which takes an array of Employees)** and prints each employees badge
- **printPaymentInfo(Takes a payable person)** and prints out their payment information
- **payPerson(which takes an array of people that are payable)** and prints their payment info
<pre><code>
Prior to sorting people by pay....
SalariedEmployee should be paid : 1000.0
HourlyEmployee should be paid : 400.0
Entrepreneur should be paid : 20000.0
</pre></code>

### Part 3b - Implement a custom way and method
**sortPeopleByIncome(which takes an ArrayList of people that are payable)**
- Then sorts them by pay and print outs their paymentInfo after sorting them
<pre><code>
After sorting people by pay...
HourlyEmployee should be paid : 400.0
SalariedEmployee should be paid : 1000.0
Entrepreneur should be paid : 20000.0
</pre></code>


### Part 4 - In the CheckCashing class (PSVM) do the following:

- Create an Entrepreneur, Salaried andHourly Employee objects
- Create an instance of the HumanResources class


- Create an array of people that are Payable
- Create an array of Employees that are payable

- Invoke the issueBadge method that takes an array of  employees

- Print out the text - “Prior to sorting by pay..”
- Invoke the payPerson method that takes an array of  people

- Initialize a new  ArrayList of payable People called unSortedPeople;
- Add your Entrepreneur Object plus the  Salaried and Hourly Employee instances to your list.

- Print out a blank line

- Finally, invoke your sortPeopleByIncome method which accepts your list of unsortedPeople

**Final Output once done should look like like this**

<pre><code>
Name: James
Type of employee: SalariedEmployee
HireDate: 2/30/2020
 
Name: Mike
Type of employee: HourlyEmployee
HireDate: 3/19/1999
 
Prior to sorting by pay...
SalariedEmployee should be paid : 1000.0
HourlyEmployee should be paid : 400.0
Entrepreneur should be paid : 20000.0

After sorting by pay...
HourlyEmployee should be paid : 400.0
SalariedEmployee should be paid : 1000.0
Entrepreneur should be paid : 20000.0
</pre></code>

### Part 5 - You must now system out:
- I freakin killed it then take a nice lil 30 minute break once your code has been reviewed by Mikaila
